# NuGet Authenticator

Provides an easy way to authenticate to an external NuGet feed.

## Building

To build this extension, [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com) must be installed (`npm i -g yarn`).

To create a new extension package, run either `gulp package`, or `gulp package-rev` (the latter increases the
patch version of the extension). If you don't have Gulp installed globally, you can use `./node_modules/.bin/gulp`.
